Jeremy and Clara are learning about passwords and created a game to test their "hacking" skills. Jeremy made rules for valid passwords and Clara needs to write a program to generate all possible passwords that meet those rules. Jeremy's rules are these:

a password consists of exactly  lowercase English letters.
the password is melodious, meaning that consonants can only be next to vowels and vowels can only be next to consonants. Example: bawahaha
the password cannot contain the letter  (because it's both a consonant and vowel).
the first letter of the password can be either a vowel or consonant.
